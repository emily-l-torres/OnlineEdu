# OnlineEdu

This is a business case utilizing various datasets from OnlineEdu* to analyze the different trends and changes for three unique aspects: Event Attendance, Class Performance, and Platform Engagement. There is an accompanying Google Slideshow with my analysis along with the code and Excel files within this repository.

The following datasets were supplied to me for this analysis:
- Demographic Data
- Event Attendance Data
- Class Performance Data
- Platform Engagement Data

To analyze each section of data, I segmented the data utilizing the following:
- Event Attendance: Age Group
- Class Performance: Geographic Location
- Platform Engagement: Age Group
